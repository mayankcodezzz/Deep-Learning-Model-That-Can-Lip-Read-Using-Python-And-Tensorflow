# Deep-Learning-Model-That-Can-Lip-Read-Using-Python-And-Tensorflow
This project uses a deep learning model with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to transcribe video to text. The model processes video frames, extracts features, and predicts corresponding text sequences. Implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, itâ€™s optimized using Adam and evaluated with CTC decoding for accurate transcriptions.
